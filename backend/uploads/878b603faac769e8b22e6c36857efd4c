Q4 Switching , circuit and packet switching
    
   Switching  

Switching is a fundamental technique used in computer networks to transfer data efficiently between devices. It helps determine the best route for data transmission, ensuring optimal network performance. There are two primary types of switching: **circuit switching** and **packet switching**.  

Circuit Switching  

Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated path is established between the sender and receiver before data transfer begins. The path remains reserved for the entire duration of the communication.  

Characteristics of Circuit Switching:  
- A dedicated channel is established before communication starts.  
- The connection remains active until the session ends.  
- Provides a constant transmission rate without delays from network congestion.  
- Used in traditional telephone networks and voice communication systems.  

Advantages of Circuit Switching:  
- Ensures a reliable and continuous connection.  
- No data loss as the path remains fixed.  
- Predictable transmission with no delay variations.  

Disadvantages of Circuit Switching:  
- Inefficient use of network resources since the dedicated path remains reserved even when no data is being transmitted.  
- High setup time, as the circuit must be established before communication begins.  
- Not suitable for bursty data traffic like internet browsing.  

Packet Switching  

Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into small packets, and each packet is sent independently over the network. The packets may take different routes and are reassembled at the destination.  

Characteristics of Packet Switching:  
- No dedicated path; packets travel independently based on network availability.  
- More efficient use of network bandwidth.  
- Each packet contains a header with routing information.  
- Used in the Internet, VoIP (Voice over IP), and modern communication networks.  

Advantages of Packet Switching:

- More reliable, as packets can be rerouted if a path fails.  
- Faster transmission in large-scale networks due to dynamic routing.  

Disadvantages of Packet Switching:  
- Packets may arrive out of order and require reassembly at the destination.  
- Possible delays due to network congestion and varying packet paths.  
- Additional processing time due to packet reordering and error checking.  

Comparison:  
- **Circuit Switching** is best for real-time applications like voice calls, where a stable connection is necessary.  
- **Packet Switching** is more efficient for data transfer over the internet, where flexibility and bandwidth optimization are important.  

Conclusion  

Switching plays a crucial role in modern networking, allowing efficient and reliable communication. While circuit switching ensures dedicated connections for uninterrupted communication, packet switching provides flexibility and better resource utilization for large-scale networks. The choice between the two depends on the application requirements, with packet switching being the dominant technology in today's internet-based communication.

Q6 All about delays
  
Delays in Computer Networks

When data is transmitted over a network, it experiences different types of delays before reaching the destination. The total time taken for a packet to travel from the sender to the receiver is influenced by four key types of delays.

Definition of Delay
Delay in networking refers to the total time required for a data packet to travel from the source to the destination. It consists of different types of delays that occur at different stages of the network transmission process. These delays impact the efficiency and speed of communication between devices.

Types of Delays
Processing Delay
This is the time taken by network devices (routers, switches) to process a packet before forwarding it.

Includes operations like checking for bit-level errors, determining the destination, and routing table lookups.

Usually very small (microseconds), but increases if the device is handling a high volume of packets.

Example: If a router processes a packet in 10 µs, the processing delay is 10 µs.

Queuing Delay
This is the time a packet spends waiting in the queue of a router or switch before being transmitted.

It depends on network congestion; if many packets are waiting, queuing delay increases.

Highly variable and unpredictable, especially in real-time applications like video calls.

Example: If a packet waits 5 ms before transmission due to congestion, the queuing delay is 5 ms.

Transmission Delay
This is the time taken to push all bits of a packet onto the transmission medium.

It depends on the packet size and the bandwidth of the link.

Formula:
Transmission Delay = Packet Size (bits) / Bandwidth (bps)

Example: If a 1,500-bit packet is sent over a 10 Mbps link:
1500 / 10⁷ = 0.00015 sec = 150 µs
So, the transmission delay is 150 µs.

Propagation Delay

The time taken for the signal to travel from sender to receiver through the medium.

It depends on the physical distance and the speed of signal propagation in the medium.

Formula:
Propagation Delay = Distance / Propagation Speed

Example: If a signal travels 2000 km over fiber optics (speed = 200,000 km/s):
2000 / 200000 = 0.01 sec = 10 ms
So, propagation delay is 10 ms.

Total Network Delay
Total delay is the sum of all four types:
Total Delay = Processing Delay + Queuing Delay + Transmission Delay + Propagation Delay

Example Calculation
Processing Delay = 10 µs

Queuing Delay = 5 ms

Transmission Delay = 150 µs

Propagation Delay = 10 ms

Total Delay:
10 µs + 5 ms + 150 µs + 10 ms = 15.16 ms

Importance of Understanding Delays
Performance Optimization: Reducing queuing delay and transmission delay improves network efficiency.

Quality of Service (QoS): Networks handling real-time applications (VoIP, video streaming) need minimal delay.

Congestion Control: Understanding queuing delays helps in designing better traffic management systems.

Conclusion
Each type of delay affects network performance. Minimizing processing delay, managing queuing delay, using high-speed links for transmission, and reducing propagation distance can improve overall network efficiency.


Q7 Layred architecture

Layered Architecture in Computer Networks
Computer networks use a layered architecture to simplify communication between devices. This architecture organizes network functionalities into separate layers, where each layer is responsible for a specific task and interacts with adjacent layers. The two main models used in networking are:

OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model

TCP/IP Protocol Stack

1. Protocol Layering
Protocol layering is the concept of dividing network communication into multiple layers. Each layer handles a specific aspect of data transmission and relies on the layer below it for services. The main advantages of protocol layering include:

Modularity: Each layer functions independently, making it easier to design and modify.

Interoperability: Different networking devices can communicate using standardized protocols.

Troubleshooting: Issues can be diagnosed at specific layers without affecting the entire system.

Scalability: New technologies can be integrated without disrupting existing layers.

For example, in the internet, a web browser uses the HTTP protocol (Application Layer), which relies on TCP (Transport Layer) to ensure reliable delivery, and TCP depends on IP (Network Layer) to route the data to its destination.

2. OSI Reference Model
The OSI Model, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), defines a seven-layer framework for network communication. Each layer performs specific tasks and interacts only with adjacent layers.

Detailed Explanation of OSI Layers
Physical Layer:

Examples: TCP, UDP.

Session Layer:

Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications.

Ensures synchronization and proper data exchange.

Examples: NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

Presentation Layer:

Converts data into a format understood by the application.

Handles encryption, decryption, compression, and character encoding.

Examples: SSL/TLS (for encryption), JPEG, ASCII.

Application Layer:

Provides network services to end-users.

Defines protocols for web browsing, email, file transfer, etc.

Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

Importance of the OSI Model
Standardizes network communication.

Allows devices from different manufacturers to work together.

Helps in network troubleshooting by isolating problems to specific layers.

3. TCP/IP Protocol Stack
The TCP/IP Model is the foundation of the modern internet. Unlike the OSI model, it has four layers, which combine some OSI layers.

Layers of TCP/IP Model
Application Layer:

Similar to OSI's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.

Provides services like web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), and file transfer (FTP).

Transport Layer:

Same as OSI Transport Layer.

Uses TCP (for reliable communication) and UDP (for fast, connectionless communication).

Internet Layer:

Similar to OSI Network Layer.

Handles IP addressing and packet routing.

Uses protocols like IP, ICMP (for error messages), and ARP (for MAC address resolution).

Network Access Layer:

Combines OSI's Physical and Data Link layers.

Manages hardware-level communication (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, PPP).

Key Differences Between OSI and TCP/IP Models
OSI has seven layers, TCP/IP has four layers.

OSI is a theoretical model, while TCP/IP is practical and widely used.

TCP/IP protocols are designed for real-world implementation in the internet.
